# Platform-Game
This is a Platform Jumper game created in Javascript. My first project that took a fair amount of time to develop as I was learning JavaScript alongside creating this. 
I turned all my separate game elements into an awesome game for the user. I this game project, I added all the required mechanics including:
• Flagpole Checkpoint
• Lives Counter and a Respawn Mechanic
• Score Counter
• Display of how many lives the user has using hearts
• Text to display when the game is over and when the level is complete
For the extension section of this assignment, I added enemies to my game. The player has to dodge these enemies or else they will lose a life and have to restart the level. I added platforms which are used to collect tokens in high spots. I also added a different length for some of my platforms and also added a “fake platform” in which the user can only stand on it for a certain part. I also added music to my game for certain actions such as jumping, plummeting, reaching the flagpole and there is also background music constantly playing. To add all of these functions I used a wide variety of code. For example, for the enemies I used to constructor function alongside a for loop and for the music I had to load it in the preload function and add p5 sound min.js to my files. Also, for the platforms I had to use an array with the factory pattern. Altogether, I made an impressive and addictive game which provides an amazing user experience and is incredibly fun to play.
